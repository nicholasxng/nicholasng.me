### Transforming Healthcare at Rally Health: Leading Through Innovation and Resilience

At Rally Health, my tenure was marked by transformative challenges that propelled our healthcare solutions to unprecedented levels. As I navigated through these endeavors, the intricacy of our systems and the grandeur of our ambitions compelled me to innovate and adapt relentlessly.

Leading the charge on the Medicare Fitness program, I found myself at the heart of healthcare innovation. Launching the UHC Medicare fitness program, my initial major initiative, generated an astounding $215M in first-year enrollment revenue, securing its place among the top ten initiatives within the company. This achievement was more than a metric; it was a testament to our ability to meaningfully connect with and impact the lives of our members. Our team, a dynamic blend of over 15 cross-functional groups, combined Agile and traditional methodologies to surpass our goals, enhancing feature delivery and user engagement. As the world adapted to a pandemic, we swiftly pivoted to establish a media portal that offered over 12,000 virtual and streaming classes, revitalizing community engagement and utilization.

In the realm of developer tooling, my advocacy for a seamless and efficient engineering environment led to significant advances. By consolidating disparate engineering activities into five cohesive DevOps programs, we saved the organization $1M annually. Yet, the real triumph was fostering a collaborative spirit through tools like Stack Overflow for Teams, revolutionizing how our engineers shared knowledge and tackled challenges, thereby reducing resolution times by a remarkable 30%. Our journey also included transitioning pilot teams to modern CI/CD tools like Helm charts and GitHub Actions, dramatically reducing cycle times and setting new benchmarks for efficiency.

Within the PMO, I spearheaded the establishment of a TPM practices committee that not only clarified roles but also streamlined processes, fostering unprecedented levels of collaboration across teams. This initiative was about more than process improvement; it was about cultivating a culture of continuous learning and adaptation, aligning everyone from product management to software engineering.

Through these roles at Rally Health, I tackled immense challenges and paved pathways for innovation, embedding resilience at the core of our operations. Like a protagonist in a complex system's narrative, each initiative I led wove into the broader fabric of our organizational transformation, driven by a relentless pursuit of excellence and a deep commitment to our community's health.
