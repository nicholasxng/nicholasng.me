### Revolutionizing Data Management at Apple: Streamlining Sales and Enhancing Global Collaboration

Facing significant challenges in data integration and quality, my role as the program manager for Core Data Management supporting Worldwide Sales involved unifying siloed data sources into a centralized repository. This effort was crucial for providing a comprehensive view and ensuring data reliability through strict quality controls and governance policies.

I aligned our sales strategies with product management's roadmap, deploying innovative data features that boosted sales efficiency by 15% and sped up product launches by 20%. To streamline processes, I standardized request handling and refined scope parameters, reducing our backlog by a third and improving delivery speed by 25%. I also prioritized enhancing collaboration across teams, establishing global forums that briefed sales leadership on upcoming products and data governance.

Despite hurdles, my commitment to value stream mapping and facilitating cross-team problem-solving sessions drove significant efficiency gains and strategic alignment across worldwide sales. My approach emphasized clear communication, pragmatic process enhancements, and structured stakeholder collaboration, effectively navigating the complexities of master data management.
